            <span>Izuku flicks his finger to create a powerful wind pressure shock wave that has enough force to break
              large chunks of ice.[16] Due to using this attack at 100%, it fractures said finger, limiting the time he
              can use this move without gravely injuring himself up to ten times</span>

            <span>Through his training with Gran Torino, Izuku was able to unlock this stage of his power and get better
              control of his Quirk. This technique allows Izuku to activate 20% (previously 5% which was then improved
              to 8%) of One For All throughout his body, letting the power course and flow through him instead of
              concentrating it in one location. According to Izuku, this technique gives him greater
              maneuverability.[18] Activating this technique gives him enhanced strength, speed, mobility, and agility.
              It also prevents him from breaking his bones when attacking. The cost of using this technique reduces the
              damage of how much his attacks do since instead of centering the power into a certain area, Izuku spreads
              it throughout his body</span>
